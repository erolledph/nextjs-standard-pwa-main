prepTime: 10
cookTime: 15
servings: 4
ingredients: 1.5 cups flour, 3.5 tsp baking powder, 1 tbsp sugar, 1.25 cups milk, 1 egg, 3 tbsp melted butter
instructions:
  1. Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a large bowl.
  2. Make a well in the center and pour in milk, egg, and melted butter.
  3. Mix until just combined. Lumps are okay! Overmixing makes them tough.
  4. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.
  5. Pour or scoop batter onto the griddle. Brown on both sides (flip when bubbles form on top).
  6. Serve hot with butter and maple syrup.

These pancakes are a weekend breakfast staple. The secret to fluffiness is fresh baking powder and not overmixing the batter. You can add blueberries or chocolate chips for a twist.
