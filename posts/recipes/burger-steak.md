# Delicious Burger Steak

Burger steak is a Filipino comfort food that's perfect for weeknight dinners. This savory-sweet patty is pan-fried and served with a rich sauce that's absolutely delicious!

## Ingredients

- 1 lb ground beef
- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs
- 1 egg
- 1/2 cup onions, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1/2 cup beef broth
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp sugar

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Meat Mixture
1. In a large bowl, combine ground beef, breadcrumbs, egg, diced onions, and minced garlic
2. Season with salt and pepper
3. Mix until well combined but don't overwork the mixture

### Step 2: Shape the Patties
1. Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions
2. Shape each portion into a flat, oval patty
3. Make them about 1/2 inch thick

### Step 3: Cook the Patties
1. Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat
2. Once butter is melted and foamy, carefully place patties in the pan
3. Cook for 4-5 minutes on each side until golden brown
4. Remove patties and set aside

### Step 4: Make the Sauce
1. In the same skillet, combine beef broth, soy sauce, and sugar
2. Stir well to combine
3. Bring to a simmer

### Step 5: Finish Cooking
1. Return the patties to the skillet with the sauce
2. Simmer for 2-3 minutes, turning patties to coat with sauce
3. The sauce should reduce slightly and coat the patties nicely

## Serving Suggestions

Serve hot with:
- Steamed rice
- Fresh vegetables
- Fried onions on top for extra crunch

## Tips & Variations

- **For softer patties:** Add a splash of milk to the meat mixture
- **Extra garlic flavor:** Use garlic powder in addition to fresh garlic
- **Spicy version:** Add 1-2 tsp of hot sauce to the sauce mixture
- **Make ahead:** Shape patties and refrigerate for up to 24 hours before cooking

Enjoy your homemade burger steak!
