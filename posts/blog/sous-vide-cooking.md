# Sous Vide Cooking - Restaurant Techniques at Home

Sous vide (French for "under vacuum") is the technique that puts restaurant-quality precision into your home kitchen. Seal food in a bag, submerge in precisely controlled water, and achieve perfect results every time.

## How Sous Vide Works

Food sealed in a bag is cooked in water at a precise temperature. Because food is surrounded by water and cooked at specific temperatures, it reaches that exact doneness throughout—no more overcooked edges with undercooked centers.

### The Science
- **Low temperature**: Water circulates and maintains exact temperature (±0.1°F)
- **Moist heat**: Water surrounds food, preventing moisture loss
- **Even cooking**: Heat transfers uniformly to center of protein
- **Precision**: Set temperature = finished temperature inside food

## Essential Equipment

### Immersion Circulator
- Heats and circulates water to precise temperature
- Clamps to edge of pot or container
- Most popular: Anova Nano, Joule, Instant Pot Accu Slim

### Vacuum Sealer
- Removes air before cooking
- Prevents floating, improves heat transfer
- Optional: Freezer bags work (water-displacement method)

### Container
- Large pot, cooler, or specialized container
- Enough water to cover food by at least 4 inches

## Temperatures for Common Foods

### Beef
- **Rare**: 129-134°F (54-57°C)
- **Medium Rare**: 134-139°F (57-60°C)
- **Medium**: 139-144°F (60-62°C)
- **Well Done**: 156°F+ (69°C+)

### Chicken (Always 165°F for food safety)
- **Tender, Moist**: 165°F (74°C), 1-4 hours
- **Extra Tender**: 167-170°F (75-77°C), 1.5-4 hours

### Pork
- **Medium**: 144-149°F (62-65°C)
- **Well Done**: 158-163°F (70-73°C)

### Fish
- **Delicate, Moist**: 122-129°F (50-54°C), 15-40 minutes
- **Firmer**: 131-135°F (55-57°C), 20-45 minutes

### Vegetables
- **Tender-Crisp**: 180-185°F (82-85°C), 20-30 minutes
- **Very Tender**: 185°F+ (85°C+), 30-45 minutes

## Perfect Steak Under Vacuum

### Ingredients
- Thick-cut steak (1.5-2 inches)
- Salt and pepper
- Butter, garlic, and thyme
- Oil for searing

### Process

1. **Pat dry**: Remove surface moisture
2. **Season**: Salt and pepper generously
3. **Vacuum seal**: Add butter, garlic, and thyme to bag with steak. Seal
4. **Sous vide**: Cook at 129°F (medium rare) for 1-3 hours
5. **Shock in ice bath**: Remove from bag, dry thoroughly
6. **Sear**: Heat oil in cast iron skillet until smoking hot
7. **Sear quickly**: 60-90 seconds per side until golden crust forms
8. **Rest**: 5 minutes before serving

### Why This Works
- Sous vide reaches exact 129°F throughout
- No gradual temperature gradient
- Steak is perfect edge-to-edge
- Searing adds crust and color
- Butter in bag flavors the steak

## Salmon with Lemon and Dill

### Ingredients
- Salmon fillet (4-6 oz)
- Butter
- Lemon slices
- Fresh dill
- Salt and pepper

### Method

1. **Prep**: Season salmon and place on parchment
2. **Bag**: Add lemon, dill, and butter. Vacuum seal
3. **Cook**: 122°F for 20-30 minutes (moist, tender)
4. **Remove**: Salmon is done when inside reaches target temperature
5. **Plate**: Serve with cooking liquid or discard

### Advantages
- Salmon never overcooks—moist and tender
- Lemon and butter infuse the fish
- Perfect results every time
- Great for meal prep (cook 4 at once)

## Batch Cooking and Meal Prep

Sous vide excels at cooking multiple portions at once:

1. **Season identically**: Ensures consistent results
2. **Seal separately**: Each protein in its own bag
3. **Cook together**: Multiple bags in same water
4. **Store**: Cooked food lasts 3-5 days refrigerated
5. **Finish**: Quickly sear or reheat when ready

### Perfect for Week-Long Meal Prep
- Monday: Cook 5 chicken breasts
- Tuesday-Friday: Sear and finish each day
- Always fresh-tasting, never reheated

## Pro Tips for Success

1. **Pat proteins dry**: Prevents water from infiltrating bags
2. **Remove air completely**: Better heat transfer, prevents floating
3. **Let food come to temp**: Most of cooking time is reaching target, not maintaining
4. **Don't skip the sear**: Crust and browning is essential for appearance and flavor
5. **Save cooking liquid**: Flavorful liquid for sauces or sipping
6. **Precise thermometer**: Verify doneness before finishing

## Troubleshooting

### Food Too Pale
**Cause**: Insufficient searing time
**Solution**: Ensure oil is smoking hot, sear longer per side

### Food Mushy
**Cause**: Too long at temp, too high temperature
**Solution**: Reduce cooking time, lower target temperature

### Bag leaking
**Cause**: Seal failure or puncture
**Solution**: Use proper vacuum-seal bags, ensure complete seal

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Overcooking duration**: More time doesn't mean better—it wastes energy
2. **Forgot ice bath**: Food continues cooking from residual heat
3. **Insufficient searing**: Skipping this step loses essential flavors and appearance
4. **Dirty water**: Keeps water circulating clean, change periodically
5. **Too crowded**: Leave space for water circulation

Sous vide removes guesswork from cooking. Once you master temperature settings, you're guaranteed restaurant-quality results every time. It's not a gimmick—it's a fundamental technique that professional kitchens rely on daily.

Start with simple proteins: steak, chicken, and salmon. Once comfortable, explore vegetables, eggs, and more complex dishes. Sous vide is the gateway to restaurant precision at home.
